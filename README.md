# Shortening algorithm

The shortening algorithm implemented relies on the ShortUrl database object ID created and managed automatically by the
database itself, which is then taken and converted from base 10 to base 62, the base 62 value is then used as a shortcode.
Note that this shortcode is not stored in the database but rather calculated on the spot using the given id.
